# 🍔 Eats Roulette 🍟

> A spontaneous restaurant picker that solves the eternal **"Where should we eat?"** debate.

## 🎯 What It Does

Eats Roulette is a simple, mobile-ready web app that:
- Gets your current location
- Lets you select a preferred radius and cuisine
- Randomly picks a nearby restaurant using the Google Places API
- Opens results directly in Google Maps

Perfect for friends who can’t agree on where to eat.

## 🧠 Origin

This idea came from a recurring problem between two friends who always argued about which restaurant to go to. Instead of fighting, they decided to let fate choose. Thus, Eats Roulette was born.
